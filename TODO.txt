Simulate is not realistic:
  1. Start day ticker, fully task pairs. Increment day, check cycle times, etc.
    - But some devs have "capacity" beyond the number of days in a release
  2. Group pairs into teams
  3. Group stories into streams to feed the teams
  4. Implement cost of moving a team member
  5. Model rework
  6. Calculate developer cycle time badwidth using PCE only, not total CT
  7. Calculate a typical deveveloper day
    - Meetings
    - Lunch
    - Goofing off
  8. Calculate relative developer effectiveness per hour

Create a set of records

Algo: Account for weekends/no weekends
Data: Account for cycle time span
Data: Account for date range

For example,

avg lead time: from and to cycles; issue types
