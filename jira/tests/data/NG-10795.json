As a production, editor or superadmin user, I want to prevent working copy creation til all apps have acknowledged it's ability to commit the (last) working copy changes in their app so that I know that the HW apps are in sync with the Master.\r\n\r\nSteps to get into this situation: \r\n1. Create a working copy\r\n2. Make changes\r\n3. If changes are made in a homework app, the app is notified via lifecycle events of each change. \r\n4. Commit working copy to master and send notification to commit working copy changes to homework app\r\n5. MT should NOT wait to receive an acknowledgement from the homework app before proceeding to commit working copy changes on MT side.  \r\nBUT \r\n6. (MT will prevent Snapshot creation-part of NG-12425), a new WC creation and (Push to Snapshot,part of NG-12426) till the acks are received or an admin override is performed.   \r\n \r\nCreating a snapshot while in this state will result in the snapshot being created without the working copy changes in the homework app and we can't allow another WC to be created until the ACK is received from the original commit\r\n\r\n*Acceptance criteria*\r\n* If working copy commit notification to homework app has a status of In Progress:\r\n** allow the commit WC changes on MindTap side but prevent a new WC from being created until the ACK has been received by MT. \r\n\r\n* edit and Push to snapshot icons will also be disabled when the ACK's from HW apps are in the pending state\r\n* Banner message on the MT will display: \r\nThis Master MindTap is waiting for acknowledgements from one or more HW apps. You cannot create a Snapshot or Working Copy or perform a Push to Snapshots.\r\n\r\n* edit (pencil) will still display for all users when in this state \r\n** testing note: only the regular lock will disable the edit icon\r\n\r\n* will unlock automatically when the ACK is returned successfully\r\n(if a user locks WC creation manually, the lock will not be removed- this may be an AC for NG-12426 - need to verify)\r\n\r\n*Testing Note*\r\n* there could be HW from more than one app in a MT.  Need to check additions/deletions of HW Activities in a WC for all HW Apps, and combos of them\r\n\r\n10/22/12 notes\r\n-Modify the story to allow the commit to complete but do not allow WC/Snapshot to be created from the Master.\r\n-  HW Apps will continue to queue the incoming messages and will sent the ACK back as it is processed. the HW apps have a timeout of 6 hours if the commit was unsuccessful\r\n","customfield_14241":null,"customfield_13431":"carrie.carter:1","customfield_13432":"2013-01-14 21:33:04.0","customfield_13430":"2013-01-15 12:24:42.0",
