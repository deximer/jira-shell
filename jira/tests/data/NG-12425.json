As a production, editor or superadmin user, I want to prevent snapshot creation til all apps have acknowledged it's ability to commit the (last) working copy changes in their app so that I know that the HW apps are in sync with the Master.\r\n\r\nSteps to get into this situation: \r\n1. Create a working copy\r\n2. Make changes\r\n3. If changes are made in a homework app, the app is notified via lifecycle events of each change. \r\n4. Commit working copy to master and send notification to commit working copy changes to homework app\r\n5. MT should NOT wait to receive an acknowledgement from the homework app before proceeding to commit working copy changes on MT side.  \r\nBUT \r\n6. MT will prevent Snapshot creation, a new WC creation and Push to Snapshot till the acks are received or an admin override is performed.   \r\n \r\nCreating a snapshot while in this state will result in the snapshot being created without the working copy changes in the homework app.  \r\n\r\n*Acceptance criteria*\r\n* If working copy commit notification to homework app has a status of In Progress:\r\n** prevent snapshots from being created \r\n** Cengage Brain and LMS will allow the course to be created on their side but when the user attempts to launch into the MT for the first time, MT will behave as today when there an error creating a snapshot (It shows blank page when testing on local machine).\r\n* will unlock automatically when the ACK is returned successfully\r\n\r\n*Testing Note*\r\n\r\n* there could be HW from more than one app in a MT. Need to check additions/deletions of HW Activities in a WC for all HW Apps, and combos of them\r\n* the 'lock'(restricted state) will be on Snapshot creation until the ACK is received \r\n\r\n\r\n*Test scenario*\r\n* may have more than one HW provisioned to a WC so need to test waiting for ACK for CNOW, Aplia  and WebAssign (not AA) - need to wait until all HW Apps returned successful ACK before releasing the lock\r\n","customfield_14241":null,"customfield_13431":"carrie.carter:1","customfield_13432":"2013-01-11 02:56:52.0","customfield_13430":"2013-01-15 12:24:09.0","issuelinks":[{"id":"193479","self":"http://jira.cengage.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/193479","type":{"id":"10031","name":"Caused By","inward":"caused","outward":"is caused by","self":"http://jira.cengage.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10031"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"592967","key":"NG-13471","self":"http://jira.cengage.com/rest/api/2/issue/592967","fields":{"summary":"Prevent Snapshot Creation Error Logs are not printing Snapshot/Course details within mindtap.log","status":{"self":"http://jira.cengage.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
